Erlang-to-C++ trans-compiler
============================

A simple cross-compiler, converts your Erlang source to Kernel Erlang and then
produces a C++ source program and accompanying CMakeLists ready to be built
using make + CMake.

Trying it out
-------------

See `Makefile` targets, `make run1`, `make run2` and `make run3` may give some
idea.
