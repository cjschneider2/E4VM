μErlang — MicroErlang
=====================

This project contains the ``Compiler``, which converts Erlang source to
compressed bytecode format (``.uerl`` files).

Also there is the ``Runtime`` — a virtual machine written in C++ which
executes the generated bytecode on the target hardware.

Latest Version

At this time there is no released stable version.
