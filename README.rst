This is a virtual machine written in C++ to run BEAM bytecode on small devices.

Cross-compiler
--------------

An experimental project which explores ways to encode BEAM with fewer
instructions and smaller size.

Building on PC
--------------

* Create a build directory, for example `mkdir build_`.
* Enter build directory: `cd build_`.
* Run CMake on it: `cmake ..`
